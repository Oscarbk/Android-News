# CSCI 4237 - Project 1 - Android News
Android News is a simple app to aggregate news from multiple sources. It can be used to view top headlines for broad categories, perform specific term searches, view news from specific sources, and view local news in different areas of the world!

## TODO
1. xml template used for sourceActivity's recyclerView and MapActivity's recyclerView should be different
2. Figure out a way to handle different size results so they are displatyed more neatly. Right now they vary much in size
3. Clean up code - redundant code in some place
4. Remove api key from commit history
5. Could use cardView instead of buttons

Note for pull request: Clicking on a source in the sourceActivity page will take you to the the source's website. Leaving as is since the results page does not need to be implemented yet
