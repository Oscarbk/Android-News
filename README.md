## TODO
1. xml template used for sourceActivity's recyclerView and MapActivity's recyclerView should be different
2. Figure out a way to handle different size results so they are displatyed more neatly. Right now they vary much in size
3. Clean up code - redundant code in some place
4. Remove api key from commit history
5. Could use cardView instead of buttons
